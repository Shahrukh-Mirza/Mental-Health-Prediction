# Mental-Health-Prediction
Mental Health Prediction Model:

Problem Statement:
Many people, whether in organizations or individually, often experience depression, anxiety, and stress, which can affect both personal well-being and professional growth. In many cases, mental health issues remain undiagnosed and untreated, putting health at risk. This project aims to predict mental health conditions early using machine learning, enabling timely support and intervention for both employees and individuals.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Descriptive statistics, Data cleaning & preprocessing Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, K-Fold Cross Validation, confusion matrix, and Accuracy Score.

My Role:
Handled data preprocessing, including handling missing data, feature scaling, and train-test splitting; implemented machine learning models (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest); applied K-fold cross-validation; and analyzed results using confusion matrix and accuracy score.

Outcome:
Logistic Regression achieved 80% accuracy on the unseen data set, demonstrating robust predictive performance.

Impact / Value:
This project showcases how AI and data-driven approaches can help both organizations and individuals monitor and improve mental health, supporting early detection, well-being, and overall productivity.
